# 12 Principles of Animation
1.  Timing and Spacing
- Keyframes are where frames land over the course of time, at a specific FPS rate
- If a ball is dropping, you want more frames at the top (when the ball is moving slowly), and less frames as the ball picks up speed and drops faster
2. Slow In and Slow Out
- Things don't start and stop immediately
- There is easing in and easing out
3. Anticipation
- Waiting and watching for something to happen
- Action before the action
- Things that would have anticipation: something that is mechanical
4. Follow Through and Overlapping Action
- There is a point that drives the motion and a point that overlaps the action
    - For example, when raising a hand, the shoulder drives the motion and the hand overlaps the action
- Follow through involves things that happen after the main action settles down/stops
5. Arcs 
- Help with showing movement and making it more fluid/dynamic
- Perspective is important, where is the arc being viewed from?
6. Exaggeration
- Overdoing something to make it more performative
- Always go further than you think
- Helps with "legibility"
7. Appeal
- Subjective
- Some foundations are well-executed to just generally look or feel good
8. Squash and Stretch
- Exaggerating poses by compressing or stretching them
- Makes things look less stiff
9. Solid Drawing
- Making things look more 3D
10. Staging
- Creating compositions
11. Straight Ahead and Pose-to-Pose Action
- Straight-ahead technique means to animate your action from drawing 1 to the end in sequence order
    - Do main poses, keyframes, inbetweens/breakdowns, etc. all at once
- Pose-to-pose technique is a bit more intricate as it means to draw the key poses first (often the beginning and end drawing of the action and some other key moment between)
    - Once the key poses are done, the breakdown and inbetween drawings are added to fill the rest of the animation
12. Secondary Action
- Actions that support or emphasize the main action to breathe more life into the animation and create a more convincing performance
    - For example: hair and clothing
